9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   1. Install Required Extensions
Before you can debug a specific type of program, make sure you have the appropriate language extension installed. For example:

JavaScript/TypeScript: Debugger for Chrome
Python: Python
C++: C/C++
Install these extensions by:

Opening the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X).
Searching for the required extension.
Clicking Install.
2. Open or Create Your Project
Open your project folder by going to File > Open Folder and selecting the folder containing your project files.
Alternatively, create a new file by right-clicking in the Explorer view and selecting New File.
3. Write Your Program
Create a simple program in your desired language. For example, a simple Python script (app.py):

python
Copy code
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
4. Configure the Debugger
Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press Ctrl + Shift + D to open the Run and Debug view.
Click on create a launch.json file link. VS Code will prompt you to select the environment for the program you want to debug (e.g., Python, Node.js, C++). Choose the appropriate environment.
VS Code will generate a launch.json file in the .vscode directory of your project. This file contains configurations for running and debugging your program.
For example, a launch.json for a Python program might look like this:


{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
5. Set Breakpoints
Open the file you want to debug.
Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers where you want to set a breakpoint, or press F9 with the cursor on the line to toggle a breakpoint.
6. Start Debugging
Press F5 to start debugging or click the green play button in the Run and Debug view.
Your program will start running, and execution will pause at any breakpoints you have set.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers. Execution pauses at these points, allowing you to inspect variables and program state.
Watch Expressions:

Add variables to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through the code.
Call Stack:

View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution. This helps in understanding the flow of your program.
Step Controls:

Use the step controls to navigate through your code:
Continue (F5): Resume program execution until the next breakpoint.
Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code, stepping over function calls.
Step Into (F11): Step into a function call to debug inside the function.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Step out of the current function, returning to the caller.
Restart (Ctrl + Shift + F5): Restart the debugging session.
Stop (Shift + F5): Stop the debugging session.
Variable Inspection:

Hover over variables in the editor to see their current values. This allows for quick inspection without having to add the variables to the Watch panel.
Debug Console:

Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and run commands within the context of the paused program. This is useful for testing hypotheses about your code's behavior.
Integrated Terminal:

The integrated terminal runs your program within the context of your VS Code workspace, providing a seamless experience between coding and debugging.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
